# About

While preparing to build [The 100 3D printer](https://github.com/MSzturc/the100) I had a hard time following parts of [the video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC4BB4BhjOo&list=PLM01o_dfwbDcKYB-9yV0vLs5k0CrHUv0W) since it all happens quite quickly so I started arranging the STL's to visualize it for myself. I though this might be of use to others.
To arrange the STL's I just used tinkercad, if you want to view it in tinkercad, [use this link](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cHlgLPrpjb7)
